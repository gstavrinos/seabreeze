 *
 * This is a simple interface for any protocol to implement
 * that provides a protocol-agnostic mechanism for accessing
 * stray light calibrations on an Ocean Optics device.
 *
 * This does not extend Protocol or otherwise get involved
 * in that hierarchy because it might interfere with the
 * lookup process for getting a Protocol object to delegate
 * these methods to.  Worse, it could end up inheriting
 * twice from the same base class, which is just messy.
