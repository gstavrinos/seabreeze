 * All messages in the Ocean Binary Protocol begin with
 * a standard 64-byte header.  It is always safe to read
 * 64 bytes for the start of a new transfer from a device
 * that supports this protocol, which works nicely with
 * the USB minimum packet size.
 *
 * This class simplifies the task of performing transactions
 * with the device, where a command is always followed
 * by a response.
