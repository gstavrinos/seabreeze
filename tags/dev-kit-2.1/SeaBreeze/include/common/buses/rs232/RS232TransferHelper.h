 *
 * This provides an abstraction around the RS232 bus.
 * RS232 is pretty simple once the port is opened and
 * configured, so this mostly just takes care of ensuring
 * that all bytes are sent and received as required.
 *
 * This will effectively block on reads and writes until
 * they are complete.  A non-blocking transfer helper
 * could be created to complement this if there was
 * some need, but it is not clear who would be responsible
 * for delayed reads or retransmits.
