The STS Dev Kit software is a daemon, originally intended to run on a Raspberry Pi, that allows one or more
Ocean Optics spectrometers to be controlled via a simple web API. In fact the code is portable and can be run
on other platforms e.g. it is developed and tested on a Windows platform.

The daemon listens on a port for connections, parses the input for a spectrometer command and any associated
parameters and issues the appropriate command to the spectrometer using SeaBreeze, returning a success/failure
code and any reponse from the spectrometer.
The class that performs the basic connection handling is RequestHandler and this passes the commands to
instances of a Spectrometer. The Spectrometer is based on an Active Object design pattern that means each spectrometer
is handled in it's own thread of execution. This gives the basic functionality of the spectrometer.
The class OceanHandler is derived from RequestHandler and provides the functionality to manage sequences of
acquisitions per spectrometer i.e. how many, how frequently etc.

Typically the daemon will service requests coming via a combination of a web server and scripts to query the daemon
but it is possible to connect to the daemon directly, bypassing the web server.

The code makes extensive use of Boost for much of the functionality from parsing to asynchronous IO.
