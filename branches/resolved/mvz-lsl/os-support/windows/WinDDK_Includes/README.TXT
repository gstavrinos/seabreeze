These files are needed to build SeaBreeze.

The WinDDK provides these files. They are redistributed here to avoid 
having installing the whole Driver Developers Kit.  Even if you do 
install the full WinDDK (likely needed for library dependencies), 
we've still found it's more convenient to use these headers rather 
than point into C:\WinDDK\nnn\inc, which can bring in numerous 
undesired conflicts.
