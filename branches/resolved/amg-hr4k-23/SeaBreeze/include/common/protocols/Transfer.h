 *
 * The Transfer class captures a simplex
 * data transfer to or from a device.  At this
 * level, there is no notion of a particular bus,
 * just data, length, and direction.
 *
 * The bus aspects are encapsulated in a "helper"
 * object that must be provided when the Transfer
 * is executed.  The helper must provide send() and
 * receive() methods taking a buffer and length
 * only.  All of the details in getting the transfer to
 * or from the other end must be handled by the helper.
 * The helper is expected to be created by some aspect
 * of the driver for the device in question.  It contains
 * information about the connection and the particulars
 * about routing data in and out.
 *
 * Note that the Transfer class is completely orthagonal to any
 * particular protocol.  It is expected that a protocol may be
 * built up as a collection of related Transfer types.
